# Final Project (Part 1)
## Outline
### Summary
For the final project, I will analyze my own personal Spotify data, particularily self-curated playlists, from 2019 thus far to formulate a tailored guide that will represent new musical selections for consumption in the upcoming year 2020. Besides perusing my own data, I am interested in comparing myself versus the "average" U.S. individual, in terms of each group's musical prospects for 2020. I was spured to tackle this project due to skeptism on Spotify's "Discover" playlists, which seems inconsistent and/or lacks satisfaction. In the Digital Age of the 21st Century, we have permitted computers and algorhythms to dicate choice, therefore, I am looking to present a chance to customize musical journeys that allign with individuals' specific musical tastes. Basically, implementing step-by-step instructions to carry self-analysis. Many Americans, no the world, listen to music on the daily, so why not have the best music that fits you? 
### Project Structure
The project will begin looking at two datasets: Spotify's Current Top 200 Songs from the U.S. (Pulled 11/13/19) and André Solomon's 2019 Spotify data (primarily from André created playlists). Looking at both data structures, it ultimately has to be organized into buckets: Genre/Mood, Artists, Albums, and Songs. Since the objective is to discover new songs for consumption, there will be limitations on selected songs, no songs that are found prior 2018 will not be considered. Once songs are put into buckets, the analysis of trend data will commence. For example, knowing that one of my top played genres is "Pop" then I can elimiinate genres that do not match that stipulation, and the same prinicple can be ultizied on the reamining buckets. Once the elimination process has been completed, there will be a truncated list of the trend data. Due to the massive amounts of music, there will have to be barriers on selection. Therefore, selction will be based on these guidlines:
- Top 5 Genres
- Top 10 Artists
- Top 20 Albums 
- Top 30 Songs
I believe that this will give enough content to conduct a deeper analyzation of the music. (Note the same principle will be applied towards the 2020 selections). After these have been determined, I will have to do some personal digging on both what the average U.S. individual and I should listen to. Ultimately, creating two new playlist. Refering back to the guidlines, the new playlists will involve the same characteristics, enough content to have a solid musical selection for the start of the new year. 
#### User Story/Motivation
For the reader, I want them to understand the process of making intentful music selections, a way to discover music that authentically resonates with their tastes. 
#### Call to Action
