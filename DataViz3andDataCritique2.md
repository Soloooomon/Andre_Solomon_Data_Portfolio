## Original Data Visualization

### Rationale for Selection
There were two reasons why I chose this particular data visualization: The Subject Matter and Aesthetic. Speaking to the first part, I have personally been affected by gun violence and wanted to view an analysis of how geographical area can have an influence on gun violence. Secondarily, the visualization was very attractive to me. Not only is it unique, compared to the standard bar chart, but also presents supplementary data (records, permits, etc.), interactive factors and comes with three organizational iterations of the data (political, regional, alphabetical) that promotes further learning for the reader. However, this assignment is focused on picking poorly presented data, therefore, this visualization contains an issue of presenting too much information that distracts from the main point. 

## Process

### Wireframe
Coming up with a solution to enhance this data visualization first started with brainstorming. Even though the visualization was unique, it could be simplified. Therefore, a simple bar graph could do justice, with each bar color red or blue to indicate political association. For the bar graph, I thought a histogram with each state being compared to the "National Gun Murder Rate" could work. Next, instead of having the supplementary information/facts (i.e.: records, permits, etc.) presented in the legend, that information could be embedded in a pop-up window when hovering above each state. Then, I decided to get rid of some information including: The Overall Gun Control Score (since the links to the Brady campaign is not functional and frankly does not support their calculated numerical score), cutting the 3 iterations of the visualization to just present the states in alphabetical order, truncating the opening paragraph, and changing the title of the visualization. 
### Wireframe Critiques 

### Using the Wireframe Critiques
Viewing feedback on my wireframe created using Balsamiq, I changed my ideas on the visualization that included: 
- Changing the Title (including the year 2012)
- Cut the histogram idea and focused solely a bar graph
- Edited the short caption of the graph 
- Made a distinction on "Murder Rate" to state "Gun Murder Rate"
- Made the supplementary information a pop-up instead of presenting it on the forefront of the visualization 
- Spelling Errors 
- Added a reference line for "National Gun Murder Rate"

## Final Visualization
Using both my own brainstorm and critiques, I created a simplified data visualization that looks at gun murder rates for each state compared with the "National Average Gun Murder Rate". In the process of simplification, I hid the supplementary data and transformed it to a pop-up feature that would display when the user hovers over singular states. Because the original graph was showing excess information that skewed the overall message, the simplification focused solely on gun murder rates which would convey a stronger case towards geographical area having an effect on gun laws and violence.
