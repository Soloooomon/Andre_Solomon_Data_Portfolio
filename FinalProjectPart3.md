# Final Project (Part 3)

## The Idea/Outline
### Project Summary (Part I)
For the final project, I will analyze my own personal Spotify data, particularily self-curated playlists, from 2019 thus far to formulate a tailored guide that will represent new musical selections for consumption in the upcoming year 2020. Besides perusing my own data, I am interested in comparing myself versus the "average" U.S. individual, in terms of each group's musical prospects for 2020. I was spured to tackle this project due to skeptism on Spotify's "Discover" playlists, which seems inconsistent and/or lacks satisfaction. In the Digital Age of the 21st Century, we have permitted computers and algorhythms to dicate choice, therefore, I am looking to present a chance to customize musical journeys that allign with individuals' specific musical tastes. Basically, implementing step-by-step instructions to carry self-analysis. Many Americans, no the world, listen to music on the daily, so why not have the best music that fits you? 

### Project Structure (Part I)
The project will begin looking at two datasets: Spotify's Current Top 200 Songs from the U.S. (Pulled 11/13/19) and my own 2019 Spotify data (primarily from created playlists). Looking at both data structures, it ultimately has to be organized into buckets: Genre/Mood, Artists, and Songs. Since the objective is to discover new songs for consumption, there will be limitations on selected songs, no songs that are found prior 2018 will be considered. For example, knowing that one of my top played genres is "Pop", I then can elimiinate genres that do not match that stipulation. The same prinicple can be applied on the reamining buckets. Once the elimination process has been completed, there will be a truncated list of the trend data. Due to the massive amounts of music, there will have to be barriers on selection. Therefore, selction will be based on these guidlines:

- Top 5 Genres
- Top 10 Artists
- Top 20 Songs

I believe that this will give enough content to conduct a deeper analysis towards the selection of music for 2020. After these have been determined, I will have to do some personal digging on both what the average U.S. individual and I should listen to. Ultimately, creating two new playlist. The new playlists will involve 20-30 songs, enough content to have a solid musical selection for the start of the new year. 

### The Data (Part I)
As I mentioned previously, I will use both the United States' and my spotify data to structure the top favorite genres, artists, and songs for each participant. Overall, a way to curate two playlists, (one for the U.S. and another for myself) which will allow both parties to tap into new musical content for the start of 2020 that more efficiently guages interest. Additionally, provide simple instructions for individuals to conduct analysis on their own; a way to give every individual the opprounity to shape their own musical journey. To create these playlists it will require me to tap into Spotify's music library and test out new content to determine if it resonates with both parties' interests.
#### U.S. Data

To my advantage, Spotify publically shares their data. The U.S. Top Charts for 2019 (Songs) can be found on Spotify's [public website](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) which shows the top charts both weekly and daily in various regions in the world. 
#### My Data

I use a program called [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com) which would take my 2019 created Spotify playlists and form a CSV file that would display: Song Title, Album, Artists, Genre, Year, Date Added and Playlists Name
### Method and Medieum (Part I)
#### Story Platform
For the project I will be utilizing the digital platform *Shorthand* to map out my data story. For my project, it will be told using a narrative approach by documenting the steps starting with acquiring the data all the way to the constructed final deliverables (playlists). It also hosts a plethora of positive user conmponents such as allowing code to be placed within the website. 
#### Recording Data & Graphing 
For measuring and presenting the data I will take advantge of Tableau to host all of the excel data and Tableau Public to allow my data visualizations to be presented publically with my readers. 
#### Brainstorms/Sketches
To collect my thought process throughout this project, I will use the digital platform Balsmiq. My reasoning is based on the final project delieverable which is an electronic presentation. Therefore, by using Balsmiq, which has the capablity to replicate a website, it will provide an easy transition for me to transfer data easier onto Shorthand.

## Final Data Story
### Intended Audience (Part III)
As this project was constructed upon two reasons: My selfish want for new music and to provide individuals access to their own music data, I did not have a specific audience in mind. However, as I progressed in this project I believe an intended audienced developed:

* Spotify Users (where all of my data dervived from and the accessory Spotify websites I used)
* Millenials and Gen Z Individuals (due to the the strong use of streaming services and data software)
* Music Listeners

To make sure my project was catering to my audience I did the following:

* Created a theme that would fit the Spotify colors 
* Incorporated artists that would resonate with younger generations (but that was only because of the data)
* Used Spotify developer websites to aid in my research ([Artist Explorer](https://artist-explorer.glitch.me), [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com) and [Magic Playlist](https://magicplaylist.co/#/?_k=21u8em))
* Created Spotify playlists 
* Everyone who I asked for feedback were in their 20s

### Final Project Summary (Part III)
From the moment I selected my topic, I knew that I was going to love this project. However, that did not mean it was easy. My project created many challenges. Even with the challenges however, I was able to find meaningful takeaways about each dataset and about the project overall. In addition, I was able to tap into my artistic side not only with the data visualizations, but with music. Having my bachelor's in music, it was interesting to observe some of the components of music indutry that affect music streaming services. As well as curating the playlists allowed me to be critical not only becasuse it would be released into the public, but would be a reflective measure of the data. I am very that these datasets were avaiable to the public and having access to Balsamiq and Tableau, which were extremely beneficial for the project. 
#### Challenges

- Overwhelming Data: I was able to download CSV files from the United States' 2019 weekly top charts, but it meant I had to download each week seperately, convert them from CSV files to Excel Files, complile all the Excels into one excel that could be uploaded into Tableau. When it came to my own Spotify data, I had started on the track of downloading it through Spotify but with the time factor (can take up to 30 days for them to get it to you), only being able to recieve 3 months worth of data, and it being in a foreign format (JSON) it was too problematic, therefore, I used the *Sounddiiz* website. If I could have started again and knew about the project in advance I would have used *last.fm* to track my music intent.
- Project Simplicity: With the goal of curating two playlists based on interest, it was difficult to generate content compared to other peers who used their data to target a problem or showcase a problem. This is why my project was a narrative telling the story of the process of findind the data with some correlary research
- Song Slection: The most laboreous part of the project was collecting new artists using the top artists generated from the initial data. Mentioned in the project website (link above) I had almost 200 artists to choose from when I completed the search. When I narrowed it down to 27 artists per each playlist, the digging was not over since out of those artists I had to find 57 songs to fill the two playlists.

#### United States Data

- To be considered in the top rankings, each individual song must have been streamed over 1 Million times
- The highest streamed songs were from reputable artists (Post Malone, Lizzo, Ariana Grande, etc.)
- Songs less streamed (closer to the 1 Million mark) were from less common artists such as Gryffin
- However, we must be mindful that humans gravitate to newly relased songs by popular artists. Which makes sense when top streamed artists release successful albums, EPs, and/or singles. Their name alone can generate streams. Yet, artists have purposefully produced albums with shorten song durations to recieve streams and dominate the charts

#### André Data

- Determining my favorite artists proved difficult because I had already made a personal endeavour to listen to new/non-mainstream artists. Therefore, my playlists contained a huge collection of different artists not particularly showing a pattern of favorites
- The majority of my music on my playlists were released 2015 and beyond, with a few older outliers
- On average each playlist contained 55 songs
- The data visually presents the fact I listen to numerous genres (i.e. Dance Pop), however, many of the genres belong to a main group (Pop, Inide, R&B, etc.) and can be consolidated

#### Overall Takeaways 

- People are influenced by new releases
- People of Color are controlling the charts due to the amount of music being released and more accessible channels
- People default to "hits" because humans are drawn to what is familiar
- Spotify gives weight to their own playlists and artists with more followers
- Bias controls what people listen to, including algorithms and this project
- Artist Promotions ($) = More Followings
