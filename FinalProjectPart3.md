# Final Project (Part 3)

## The idea
### The project outline (Part I)
### A high-level summary of your project.  (Part I)
For the final project, I will analyze my own personal Spotify data, particularily self-curated playlists, from 2019 thus far to formulate a tailored guide that will represent new musical selections for consumption in the upcoming year 2020. Besides perusing my own data, I am interested in comparing myself versus the "average" U.S. individual, in terms of each group's musical prospects for 2020. I was spured to tackle this project due to skeptism on Spotify's "Discover" playlists, which seems inconsistent and/or lacks satisfaction. In the Digital Age of the 21st Century, we have permitted computers and algorhythms to dicate choice, therefore, I am looking to present a chance to customize musical journeys that allign with individuals' specific musical tastes. Basically, implementing step-by-step instructions to carry self-analysis. Many Americans, no the world, listen to music on the daily, so why not have the best music that fits you? 

### A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story. (Part I)
The project will begin looking at two datasets: Spotify's Current Top 200 Songs from the U.S. (Pulled 11/13/19) and my own 2019 Spotify data (primarily from created playlists). Looking at both data structures, it ultimately has to be organized into buckets: Genre/Mood, Artists, and Songs. Since the objective is to discover new songs for consumption, there will be limitations on selected songs, no songs that are found prior 2018 will be considered. For example, knowing that one of my top played genres is "Pop", I then can elimiinate genres that do not match that stipulation. The same prinicple can be applied on the reamining buckets. Once the elimination process has been completed, there will be a truncated list of the trend data. Due to the massive amounts of music, there will have to be barriers on selection. Therefore, selction will be based on these guidlines:

- Top 5 Genres
- Top 10 Artists
- Top 20 Songs

I believe that this will give enough content to conduct a deeper analysis towards the selection of music for 2020. After these have been determined, I will have to do some personal digging on both what the average U.S. individual and I should listen to. Ultimately, creating two new playlist. The new playlists will involve 20-30 songs, enough content to have a solid musical selection for the start of the new year. 

### A short paragraph that documents your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. (Part I)
As I mentioned previously, I will use both the United States' and my spotify data to structure the top favorite genres, artists, and songs for each participant. Overall, a way to curate two playlists, (one for the U.S. and another for myself) which will allow both parties to tap into new musical content for the start of 2020 that more efficiently guages interest. Additionally, provide simple instructions for individuals to conduct analysis on their own; a way to give every individual the opprounity to shape their own musical journey. To create these playlists it will require me to tap into Spotify's music library and test out new content to determine if it resonates with both parties' interests.

To my advantage, Spotify publically shares their data. The U.S. Top Charts for 2019 (Songs) can be found on Spotify's [public website](https://spotifycharts.com/regional) which shows the top charts both weekly and daily in various regions in the world.

I use a program called [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com) which would take my 2019 created Spotify playlists and form a CSV file that would display: Song Title, Album, Artists, Genre, Year, Date Added and Playlists Name
### A few paragraphs summarizing your approach to the project (method and medium - Part I)
#### Story Platform
For the project I will be utilizing the digital platform *Shorthand* to map out my data story. For my project, it will be told using a narrative approach by documenting the steps starting with acquiring the data all the way to the constructed final deliverables (playlists). It also hosts a plethora of positive user conmponents such as allowing code to be placed within the website. 
#### Recording Data & Graphing 
For measuring and presenting the data I will take advantge of Tableau to host all of the excel data and Tableau Public to allow my data visualizations to be presented publically with my readers. 
#### Brainstorms/Sketches
To collect my thought process throughout this project, I will use the digital platform Balsmiq. My reasoning is based on the final project delieverable which is an electronic presentation. Therefore, by using Balsmiq, which has the capablity to replicate a website, it will provide an easy transition for me to transfer data easier onto Shorthand.

## Final data story
### Intended Audience
As this project was constructed upon two reasons: My selfish want for new music and to provide individuals access to their own music data, I did not have a specific audience in mind. However, as I progressed in this project I believe an intended audienced developed:

* Spotify Users (where all of my data dervived from and the accessory Spotify websites I used)
* Millenials and Gen Z Individuals (due to the the strong use of streaming services and data software)
* Music Listeners

To make sure my project was catering to my audience I did the following:

* Created a theme that would fit the Spotify colors 
* Incorporated artists that would resonate with younger generations (but that was only because of the data)
* Used Spotify developer websites to aid in my research ([Artist Explorer](https://artist-explorer.glitch.me), [Discover Quickly](https://discoverquickly.com) and [Magic Playlist](https://magicplaylist.co/#/?_k=21u8em))
* Created Spotify playlists 
* Everyone who I asked for feedback were in their 20s
